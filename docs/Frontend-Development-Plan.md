## Mobile Compatibility Considerations

### Code Reusability Strategy
1. **Business Logic Separation**: All business logic in `/hooks` and `/services`
2. **API Layer**: Shared API services between web and mobile
3. **State Management**: Redux store can be shared
4. **Component Architecture**: UI components designed for platform adaptation

### Cross-Platform Structure
```
src/
├── hooks/           # Shared business logic
├── services/        # Shared API and business services
├── store/           # Shared Redux store
├── types/           # Shared TypeScript definitions
├── utils/           # Shared utility functions
├── constants/       # Shared constants
├── components/      # Platform-adaptable UI components
├── pages/           # Web-specific page components
└── styles/          # Portable styling approach
```

### Technology Choices for Compatibility
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit (works in both web and React Native)
- **HTTP Client**: Axios (works in both platforms)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form (compatible with both)
- **Validation**: Yup (cross-platform compatible)
- **Storage**: Custom abstraction layer for localStorage/AsyncStorage

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase Completion Criteria
- [ ] All deliverables completed and tested
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility standards met
- [ ] Mobile compatibility verified

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% for critical paths
- **Performance**: Lighthouse score > 90
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Cross-browser**: Support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Responsive**: Tested on various screen sizes

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Integration**: Mock API setup for independent development
- **Performance**: Regular performance audits and optimization
- **Browser Compatibility**: Progressive enhancement approach
- **Security**: Regular security audits and best practices

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Clear phase definitions and approval processes
- **Dependency Delays**: Parallel development where possible
- **Resource Availability**: Buffer time in estimates
- **Technical Challenges**: Research spikes for complex features

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start Phase 1 - Project Setup & Architecture Foundation
2. **Week 1**: Complete project initialization and basic structure
3. **Week 2**: Set up development environment and tooling
4. **Week 3**: Begin Phase 2 - Authentication system development

This plan ensures systematic development while maintaining code quality and future mobile compatibility.
